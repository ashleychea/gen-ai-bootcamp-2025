# GenAI Engineering Bootcamp: Real-World AI Development

## Overview

Hello there, my name is Ashley and I‚Äôm currently enrolled in an **AI Engineering Bootcamp** designed to **bridge the gap between AI hype and practical implementation** by equipping participants with the skills to **build, optimize, and deploy real-world GenAI workloads.** Targeting professionals across all levels‚Äîfrom beginners to enterprise experts‚Äîthe program follows a Maturity Model approach, ensuring progressive learning and hands-on experience in AI-powered applications, cloud services, and production deployment.

## üîç The Problem This Bootcamp Solves

GenAI has been hyped due to massive VC investments, leading to confusion and unrealistic expectations in both technical and business circles. Many developers, directors, and executives lack clarity on AI's real capabilities, limitations, and implementation challenges. This bootcamp provides a structured pathway to:
- Understand the AI landscape‚Äîits strengths, limitations, and practical applications.
- Develop critical thinking & troubleshooting skills to build real-world GenAI solutions.
- Gain hands-on experience with AI development, optimization, and deployment.

## Who Is This For?

- **Beginner-Level Engineers & Developers** wanting to get started with AI-powered assistants and prompt engineering.
- **Intermediate-Level AI Practitioners** looking to explore AI-as-a-Service, cloud solutions, and open-source models.
- **Advanced AI Engineers** focusing on model training, optimization, and quantization.
- **Enterprise & Expert-Level Professionals** aiming to deploy AI at scale with compute-efficient architectures.

## What I'll Be Doing

I'll work on various AI-powered learning applications, potentially including:

- **Daily Life Visual Novel Generator** ‚Äì Create a town-based interactive experience where users engage in conversations that maintain context and character history.
- **Japanese Text Adventure** ‚Äì Develop a text-based adventure that gradually introduces Japanese vocabulary and writing.
- **Japanese Sentence Constructor** ‚Äì Build an AI assistant that helps users translate English phrases into Japanese interactively.
- **Sign to Speak** ‚Äì Utilize computer vision and a webcam to help users practice ASL finger-spelling.
- **Subtitles to Vocabulary** ‚Äì Extract vocabulary from movie subtitles using **large language models (LLMs)** and process them into structured **JSON** data.
- **Speech to Learn** ‚Äì Implement **automatic speech recognition (ASR)** for real-time language pronunciation practice.
- **Japanese Teaching Assistant** ‚Äì Use **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to extract text and enable **question-answering AI** for enhanced learning experiences.
